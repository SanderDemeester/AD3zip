     DNSSEC and TLSA records for IMAP, POP3, and message submission
                         draft-fanf-dane-mua-00

Abstract

   This specification describes the effect that DNSSEC has on SRV-based
   autoconfiguration and TLS certificate verification in the mail user
   agent protocols IMAP, POP3, and message submission.  It also
   describes how to use TLSA DNS records to provide stronger
   authentication of server TLS certificates.

Internet-Draft          DNSSEC and TLSA for MUAs               June 2012


1.  Introduction

   The mail user agent protocols IMAP [RFC3501], POP3 [RFC1939], and
   message submission [RFC4409] support upgrade from cleartext to TLS
   [RFC5246].  The STARTTLS command is part of the core IMAP
   specification [RFC3501].  Message submission is a profile of SMTP
   [RFC5321] for which there is a STARTTLS extension [RFC3207].  In POP3
   the equivalent command is STLS [RFC2595].  IMAP and POP3 are also
   often deployed using TLS-on-connect on alternate TCP ports.

   [RFC6186] specifies how an MUA can use SRV records to automatically
   locate mail server host names given the user's mail domain.
   Section 2 of this specification updates [RFC6186] to clarify how MUAs
   handle mail server SRV records and TLS negotiation in the presence
   and absence of DNSSEC.

   Section 3 of this specification describes how to use TLSA DNS records
   [I-D.ietf-dane-protocol] to provide stronger authentication of server
   TLS certificates.  We also use the existance of a TLSA record to
   signal to the MUA that it can expect the server to offer TLS.

   In the rest of this memo, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
   "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in [RFC2119].


2.  DNSSEC, TLS, and mail server SRV records

   When negotiating TLS, the MUA MUST use the Server Name Indication
   extension (TLS SNI) [RFC6066] with its preferred name as defined
   below.  This is a stricter requirement than [RFC6186].

   When a security-aware MUA looks up [RFC6186] SRV records, it SHALL
   take note of the DNSSEC status [RFC4033] of each record.  It
   constructs the list of reference identifiers for verifying each
   server's TLS certificate [RFC6125] and chooses the preferred name for
   TLS SNI as follows:

   bogus:  The MUA MUST abort.  (If this occurs during auto-
      configuration, it might fall back to a manual setup procedure.)

   insecure or indeterminate:  The reference identifiers SHALL include
      the source domain (i.e. the user's mail domain) and MUST NOT
      include the derived domain (i.e. the SRV target host name).  The
      source domain is the preferred name for TLS SNI.

   secure:  The reference identifiers SHALL include both the source
      domain (i.e. the user's mail domain) and the derived domain (i.e.
      the SRV target host name).  The derived domain is the preferred
      name for TLS SNI.


3.  Mail server TLSA records

   MUAs SHALL look up the TLSA record(s) for a mail server using its
   host name and port number, as described in section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-dane-protocol].  The MUA MUST only do this if the host name
   and port number have been obtained securely, from the "target" and
   "port" fields of a SRV record that is secure as described in the
   previous section, or from user configuration.

   If a TLSA record is usable as described in section 4.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-dane-protocol], then the server MUST support TLS.  It MUST
   present a certificate that matches the TLSA record and that
   authenticates the server host name.

   When an MUA is configuring itself as described in section 4 of
   [RFC6186], it SHOULD use the presence of a TLSA record to indicate
   that use of TLS is obligatory when connecting to the corresponding
   server.


4.  Guidance for mail service providers

   A mail server that is the target of an [RFC6186] SRV record MUST have
   a TLS certificate that authenticates the SRV owner domain (i.e. the
   user's mail domain).  This is necessary for clients that cannot
   perform DNSSEC validation.  This certificate MUST be the default that
   is presented if the client does not use the TLS Server Name
   Indication extension (TLS SNI) [RFC6066].

   In order to support this specification, the mail server MUST also
   have a certificate that authenticates the SRV target domain (the mail
   server hostname).  This can be done using a multi-name certificate or
   by using the client's TLS SNI to select the appropriate certificate.
   The mail server's TLSA record MUST correspond to this certificate.

   Note: old pre-[RFC6186] clients expect a mail server's TLS
   certificate to authenticate its host name; they are also unlikely to
   support SNI.  This means that servers for old clients need a
   different default certificate from [RFC6186] servers.  If the server
   does not have a certificate that authenticates all relevant names, it
   is necessary to segregate old and new clients.  This can be done by
   using different target hosts or non-standard ports in the SRV

   targets.  (The latter avoids the need for yet more certificates.)


5.  Guidance for mail server software authors

   In order to support this specification, mail server software MUST
   implement the TLS Server Name Indication extension [RFC6066] for
   selecting the appropriate certificate.


6.  Security considerations

   The MUA autoconfiguration specification [RFC6186] does not have a
   complete mechanism for signalling whether a server supports TLS.
   IMAP and POP3 have alternate TLS-on-connect ports, but not message
   submission.  This gap is filled by using the presence of TLSA records
   to indicate that a client can expect a server to support TLS.  This
   prevents a downgrade attack.

   The guidance in Section 2 is mostly a straightforward consequence of
   the requirements set out in [RFC6125] and [RFC6186].


7.  Internationalization Considerations

   If any of the DNS queries are for an internationalized domain name,
   then they need to use the A-label form [RFC5890].


8.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA action is needed.

Appendix A.  Rationale - where to put TLSA records

   The long-term goal of this specification is to settle on TLS
   certificates that verify the server host name rather than the mail
   domain, since this is more convenient for servers hosting multiple
   domains and scales up more easily to larger numbers of domains.

   There are a number of other reasons for doing it this way:

   o  The certificate is part of the server configuration, so it makes
      sense to associate it with the server name rather than the mail
      domain.

   o  When the server certificate is replaced it is much easier if there
      is one part of the DNS that needs updating to match, instead of an
      unbounded number of hosted mail domains.

   o  The same TLSA records work with and without [RFC6186] SRV records.

   o  Consistency with [I-D.fanf-dane-smtp] and
      [I-D.miller-xmpp-dnssec-prooftype].

   There is no option to put TLSA records under the mail domain in order
   to keep the specification simple and to make it easier to deploy
   correctly.

   The disadvantage is that the expected certificate differs between
   pure [RFC6186] clients and clients that are implemented to this spec.
   This means that Server Name Indication support is necessary for
   backwards compatibility.
